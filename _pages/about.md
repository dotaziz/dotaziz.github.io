My name is Abdul Aziz. I am a final-year BSc. IT student at the University of Cape Coast, and the GDG on Campus Lead.

Aside from my full-time studies, I am also helping to build the next-gen insurance solutions for Africa with [Insurerity Digital](https://insurerity.com/).
Free time? I spend some time with [Achievers Ghana](https://achieversghana.org/), introducing kids to programming and anything tech.

I guess that's all for now.

I'll be happy to collaborate with any motivated individual in building systems! If you're interested, kindly shoot me an email.
