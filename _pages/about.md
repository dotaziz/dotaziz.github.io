My name Abdul Aziz. I am an IT (Bsc Information Technology) student at the University of Cape Coast, currently in my third year.

Aside my fulltime studies, I am also helping to build the next-gen insurance solutions for Africa with [Insurerity Digital](https://insurerity.com/).
Free time? I spend sometime with [https://achieversghana.org/](https://achieversghana.org/), introducing kids to programming and anything tech.

I guess that's all for now.

I'll be happy to collaborate with any motivated individual in building systems! If you're interested, kindly shoot me an email.
