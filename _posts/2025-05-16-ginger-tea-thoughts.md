I tried to write a line of code <br>
Wasn't good enough. <br>
Tried to craft a verse <br>
Wasn't poetic enough. <br>
Tried expressing thoughts<br>
They weren't eloquent enough.<br>
Tried connecting engergies<br>
Weren't compatible enough.<br>

But you know what is enough?<br>

That quiet, relentless spark<br>
The human urge to keep striving<br>
The stubborn flame of becoming.<br>
That natural pull toward greatness,<br>
Even when the world feels out of reach.<br>

And before you ask what changed?<br>
Nothing changed.<br>

I'm still not good enough.<br>
But maybe,<br>
Just maybe<br>
With this eternal tinglig urge,<br>
I am good enough.<br>

I wrote around 1:00 am after coming back from a GMSA inter-hall Qur'an competition. My hall(KNH) was last but one.
I had to be worried about my halls performance, after all I was the vice president of the Muslim Council.

So I just boiled some ginger to drink when I got to my hostel.
