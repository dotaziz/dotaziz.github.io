I was scrolling through my Google Keep archives and stumbled upon a note I created during my freshman year at UCC(currently in my final year), titled "Beginners in Tech." The note contained advice I had shared in our newly created class WhatsApp group. According to Google Keep, it was "Edited Apr 26, 2023." 

I wrote it to help fellow freshmen navigate the initial challenges and uncertainties they might face in the tech field. At the time, I had been working with Insurerity for less than a year. Looking back, I realized that the advice I gave was shaped by my early experiences and hard-learned lessons...I wanted to help others separate the signal from the noise of information overload.

Here's the full note:

> Good evening, here.
> I hope this finds you well.
>
> One thing all successful 
> 'Tech people ' say is: 'School won't teach you hardcore programming/technology skills, but will teach you to appreciate the technology.' 
>
> The only person to do that is 'yourself'.
> That said, there's a lot to learn in the tech space. As beginners, we're always bombarded with buzzwords like learn this, know that.
>
> The only good thing you can do for yourself when learning tech skills is to ask yourself, 
>
> 'What do I want to do/ solve with technology?', 
>
> 'Why do I want to learn this language/skill?'
>
> 'Will this language/skill help me in the solution I am seeking?'
>
> Once you're able to figure these out, the answers to questions like what to learn, how to learn, and where to learn will eventually come out.
>
> Most beginners follow buzzwords: 
>
> 'Oh, learn this skill, you'll earn $4k', 
>
> 'Oh, web3 is the future, let it now
>
> 'learn Python, learn HTML, etc.'
>
> I am not saying don't listen to advice from people, but one thing that's for sure is that  'tech' is hard, and programming and learning to code are hard. 
> Getting your first paycheck/employment is hard.
> Yes, it's meant to be hard to take impostors out.
> If it were easy, then the reward wouldn't be great, as everyone can do it.
>
> Also, it takes 7 years to become a doctor.
> So don't expect to be an expert in programming after learning for 3 months or 1 year.  Also, you won't be employable after 3 months of learning;  it takes years, and some people are lucky to be exceptions to this rule. But it happens rarely.
> Progress compounds, but it's not linear. Keep pushing, the dots will connect one day. Everyone suffered to learn to code; you won't be the first or the last.
>
> So to strive and persevere through the struggles and frustrations, you should like what you are learning, and there should be a purpose to it. 
> Once you pass the beginner stage, you'll be free to learn what's trending, but for now, stick to something that has meaning to you.
>
> After you pass the beginner stage, you may realize it wasn't what you wanted, but it's a conversation for another time.
